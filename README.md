# EasyLists

This is a simple to use yet really convenient app for the creation of different types of lists.

* The UI was made using **Jetpack Compose**
* For the data management I use the **Room library**
* It implements the **MVVM** architecture 
* Also uses **Dagger Hilt** for a better scalability 

## Screenshots 
  This are some examples of the different types of list that have the app
